        "A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. Classes represent real-world things and situations; they define a set of attributes (properties/data) and methods (functions/behavior) that objects created from the class will have. For example, a Dog class can define the properties and behaviors common to all dogs, such as having a name and age, and being able to sit and roll over.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **object** is an **instance** of a class. When you create an object, you are creating an actual entity based on the class blueprint. Each object can have different values for the attributes defined by its class. For example, you can create multiple Dog objects, each with different names and ages.\n",

        "**Instantiation** is the process of creating an object from a class. When you instantiate a class, you create an **instance** (object) of that class.\n",
